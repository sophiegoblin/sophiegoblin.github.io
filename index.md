*[The Big Art Herstory Project](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/)*<br>
**Scrum Master**

The Big Art Herstory Project runs educational drawing tours across London’s museums and galleries, designed to offer anyone a compelling way to learn about the overlooked female narratives of Art History. My team is working on Feminist Creative Networking events and is preparing to launch London’s first Feminist Art and Anthropology Festival in 2020. As Scrum Master, I motivate the weekly sprints, manage timelines, tasks and conflict resolutions to achieve the most value in a short space of time.

*[Kollektiv Gallery](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/)*<br>
**Founder and Curator **
<br>
<br>
At Kollektiv I produce residencies, festivals, exhibitions and symposiums. Interested in the ethics of inhabiting space by reacting to the semiotics of the city; a car, empty butchery, office, warehouse or laptop become the backdrop for artists work. This work is done in tandem with creative play, survival and entrepreneurial drive.
<br>
<br>
I [design, run workshops](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) and give talks, [publish interviews](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/), [online publications](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/manual/), [podcasts](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/learning-unlearning-conversation-piupiu-faith-dilo) and manage artists too. If you'd like to discuss a flexible consultancy that suits you, drop me an email.

**Magazine Editor **<br><br>
Foss is a self-initiated internet magazine which explores the interludes between art, fashion and sport. My co-editor and I are avid cyclists, swimmers and football fanatics, we see vibrant playful and political art being made within these intersection which we decided to start archiving into one Instagram account. Inspired by the Women’s World Cup, we attend London matches and sport exhibitions, joined a football reading book club and interview artists working in this sphere.

*Hayward Gallery, London*<br>
**Tour Guide**<br><br>
Hayward Gallery is a world-renowned contemporary art gallery and a landmark of brutalist architecture at Southbank Centre in London. I absorb and relay knowledge to the public about the artist, the cultural environment of each work and the curatorial direction for the exhibition and well as train other tour guides. I have delivered hour long tours for Lee Bul: Crashing, Space Shifters and Kader Attia: Museum of Emotion. I take round architects, university students, Sotheby’s employees and any member of the public. I was chosen for this position for my clear and adaptable public speaking skills, and my ability to ensure the visitor’s experience is kept to an extremely high standard.

*Hayward Gallery, London*<br>
**Visitor Experience Host **<br><br>
Hayward Gallery’s year-round exhibition programme focuses on presenting a wide range of adventurous and influential artists from across the world. As a Visitor Experience Host I am trained to be a world class expert and advocate of artistic knowledge for visitors on site, seeking out conversations to have about the art with visitors. I use active listening to discuss the exhibition. It’s through these conversations I help visitors, steak holders and potential funders access the exhibition in a unique and memorable way.

*Koko Black*<br>
**Brand Strategist and Copywriter**<br><br>
Bryce Ford is the Creative Director of Koko Black, a contemporary chocolate company in Melbourne, Australia. I was contracted to research and rewrite Koko Black’s new brand strategy. This included collecting data and refining research on competitors, finding a tone of voice to fit the new aesthetic direction and to present all the information in an easily digestible document for the board and investors. After that work was complete, I was hired as a copywriter to produce written content for the website, social media posts, seasonal events, competitions and names of products.

*[Cyber Nectar](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/)*
<br>**Festival Director and Producer **
<br><br>
Funded by Wellington City Council funded, New Zealand . Cyber Nectar references warm, alive bodies interacting with cold, dry pieces of technology. Roy Ascott theorised the term ‘moist media’ as a way of describing, ‘where wet living biologies meet dry computational systems’. Cyber Nectar responds and critiques issues raised by both Roy Ascott and other early cyber feminists by examining the psychological and physical experience of proto-digital life.

At what point does femininity become synonymous with apology? Who hurt the people who hurt you? DARKMATTER’s Alok Vaid-Menon is trying to figure it out.”<br><br>
In collaboration with Garage Project, Women’s Refuge New Zealand, Wellington Rape Crisis, InsideOUT, an incredible organisation who work to make Aotearoa a safe(r) place for young people of diverse genders and sexualities.

*[Indulge in my vanity](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/curatorial-intervention-laura-duffy-nathaniel-gordon-stables/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at MEANWHILE GALLERY, Wellington, New Zealand . Curatorial intervention of The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use with tryptic video work by Nathaniel Gordon-Stables, accompanied by writing by Laura Duffy and edited by Dilohana Lekamge. In the curatorial intervention of the group show The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use (It is a relationship entered into) Laura Duffy has created space for an artist she feels deserves recognition, Nathaniel Gordon Stables. Nathaniel isn’t wāhine, he is tangata ira tane as well as takatāpui.
<br><br>
The idea of the curatorial intervention was to disrupt the notion of ‘women’, not only in the pre-existing exhibition, but to reconstruct the constraints that ‘women’ has as a category in order to be more inclusive and diverse. Cyber Nectar surrounds ideas of decolonisation: takatāpui in itself has an unfortunate history of being erased  within the process of colonisation and the western documentation of Maori culture. This intervention attempts to respect takatāpui and allow them to gain more visibility.

A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Emporium Vintage, Wellington, New Zealand . Text video installation, duration 5 minutes (continuous loop), Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg in collaboration with Sean Burn.<br><br>In rhetoric, parrhesia is a figure of speech described as: “to speak candidly or to ask forgiveness for so speaking”. In August 2016 Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg undertook a week long takeover of the Lokal stories Instagram and Twitter accounts. HPA wrote almost a thousand tweets. JB erased all of these by deleting approximately 150-200 a day. ‘Parrhesia’ is a selection of these tweets, which act as a series of poems or anxious truths around intimacy, grief, capitalism and how we mediate our ‘selves’, emotions and relationships through technology. Parrhesia is a animated text work designed by irl angel, Sean Burn.

**Producer and Project Manager**
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Fusion Surf Skate, Wellington, New Zealand . Performative video installation, duration 3 min 33 sec (continuous loop), Jordana Bragg and Hana Pera Aoake, in collaboration with Laura Duffy.<br><br>This video work uses the ocean and water as a way to frame the anxiety and emotional labours of capitalism and digital life. Filmed and edited in collaboration with Laura Duffy this video work flickers between footage spliced together to mimic the multitude of tabs open online. Its rhythm is designed to reflect the exponential rate at which colonialism and neoliberalism is destroying the world, and the paradoxical way capitalism and imperialism has constructed our identities and affected the rate of our productivity.

**Producer and Project Manager**
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at MEANWHILE GALLERY, Wellington, New Zealand . There is no one universalised experience of ‘otherness’, but how might these individual narratives we live come together to inform a complexity of concerns around the body and digital life? The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use (It is a relationship entered into) is an exhibition of work by national and international wāhine artists and writers. Each artist creates work that is embodied, marked by their experiences and offers ways of expressing empathy through self care, repetition, unlearning/learning and humour.

*Femur Design*<br>
**Digital Project Manager**
<br><br>
Femur Design is a small team of developers who design and build musical instruments to help people learn how to play music. At Femur Design I helped manage the team that designs instant and intuitive musical experiences for the web, iOS and Android. For example [Theremin](https://femurdesign.com/theremin/) is a touch playable synthesiser. I collaborated with the team on the timeline and managed the brand strategy, launch, press releases, videos and mail outs. Our most recent project involved two other senior developers to create [Blokdust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNZfOMJybjM), a web app which allows users to build instruments and make self-playing sound environments.<br>

*National Citizen Service*<br>
**Mentor and Workshop Leader **
<br><br>
I think it’s important to empower young people, that’s why I worked with the National Citizen Service. I guided 16-19 year olds to volunteer at their local dementia homes, to share their joint passion for art and music with the elderly people they visited. These experiences have taught me the importance of safeguarding, participating in youth lead curriculums and clear communication in challenging circumstances.

*Kollektiv Gallery*<br>
**Creative Consultant**
<br><br>
Creative consulting came very naturally after taking 60 artists and illustrators through the Kollektiv residencies. Word got around that someone a similar age was trying to find more work for creatives in Brighton. That’s when I became interested in contracts, licences, payments and learnt a lot from the AOI. Double Gazing was one of the projects I worked on with illustrator and Kollekitv Alumni, Amy Brown. She was already drawing fantastic portraits through windows for fun when we started having regular consultancy chats. Together we decided to brand what she was doing as Double Gazing and design a package to sell at events. Since then, Amy has drawn at Southbank Centre, magazine launches and gallery openings.

Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under 2 hours. Fast Art lovingly forces us to trust our gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside each of ourselves. The workshop smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allows us to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation, whilst reigniting a love for idea generation, team spirit and face-to-face selling.

I opened this gallery with 10 Kollektiv artists at 16 Brighton Square, funded by Kickstarter, Santander and Brighton University, supported by Brighton Fringe and Open House Brighton  . After publicising the opportunity, interviewing and choosing the artists, together we completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, worked with We Are Pop Up to find a vacant shop in Brighton and turn it into a pop up gallery for one month. Every artist taught a workshop and we also hosted guest speakers and musicians as well.

*The Butchery* <br>
**Founder, Producer, Artist Manager**
<br><br>
In 2013 I founded Kollektiv Gallery after seeing more and more artists fall into unpaid work “opportunities”. Kollektiv started as school, building residencies for creatives to learn new skills, like launch a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kollektivgallery/kollektivs-first-ever-gallery), open a gallery, learn about contracts, put on an event, sell art and connect with the community.
<br><br>
Kollektiv it has taken many forms. From the school, it merged into a mini agency, connecting creatives to businesses. Artists, photographers, animators and illustrators would take part in a picture interview to be part of the archive, acting as a publicity tool and portfolio for clients to view. 
<br><br>
Kollektiv then started producing art festivals, which started in Brighton and ended up in Wellington, New Zealand. The festivals were funded by the government and council and included, podcasts, documentaries, exhibitions and symposiums. Collaborating with a wide array of institutions, charities and community members, the festival format became one of my favourites.

<h3 class="center">PUBLISHING </h3>
<br>
Since <span class="bold-number">2014</span> I have published over <span class="bold-number">200</span> [picture interviews](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/) on Kollekitv Gallery. I ask 10 questions and artists respond visually. This method of networking and publicity compliments my curatorial relationship with artists, a way for artists to develop their visual practice as well as have content to share online.<br>

Here are a few examples.<br>

[Jordana Bragg](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/jordana-bragg/), multi-disciplinary artists based in New Zealand, Concentrating on the metaphysics of love and loss, their practice discloses a characteristically dangerous personal and universal sense of vulnerability, informed by wider research around issues of identity and gender fluidity. Bragg is co-founder of the artist run initiatives Meanwhile (NZ) and Friends are Artists/Freunde sind Künstler (DE).

[Alicia King](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/alicia-king/) is an interdisciplinary artist from Melbourne Australia, her practice explores contemporary and cultural relationships with technology. She responds to today’s global engagement with technology that eternally places humans on the brink of the future. King examines tools of biological technologies to understand perspectives of the human body as a conceptually loaded, complex and raw material.
