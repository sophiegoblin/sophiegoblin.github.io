<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Since <span class="bold-number">1989</span> my lifelong creative education has ranged a beautiful repository of research around (and in no particular order) the phenomenon of the internet, social justice, science vs. colonialism, architecture and cities, anthropology, fear and finance, philosophy and mental health.

On here you'll find my extended CV. Scroll through my projects, art festivals and galleries. Lists of workshops, talks and examples of interviews I publish. Yes sirree, email to talk project management, creative consultancy, teaching workshops and public speaking. I'm interested.

*[The Big Art Herstory Group](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/)*<br>
**ScrumMaster**

The Big Art Herstory Group was founded in response to a growing concern that only one perspective of the Art-Historical record ever seems to get told. Lead by Founder Luisa Maria MacCormack who teaches the themed drawing tours; [SACRED FEMININE: The Art of the Goddess](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/sacred-feminine) and [THE HYSTERICAL BODY: Sexuality Medicine and the Female Form](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/the-hysterical-body) and many more at renowned London institutions like the Hayward Gallery, V&A, British Museum and Wellcome Trust, our small team of three is currently working on Feminist Crative Networking evenings and London's first Feminist Art and Anthropology Festival in 2020. As the teams's ScrumMaster, I support the team in organising, time management, conflict resolution and motivating the weekly sprints.<br><br>

<span class="bold-number">2013 - 2019</span><br>
*[Kollektiv Gallery](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/)*<br>
**Founder and Curator **
<br>
<br>
At Kollektiv I produce residencies, festivals, exhibtions and symposiums. Interested in the ethics of inhabiting space by reacting to the semiotics of the city; a car, empty butchery, office, warehouse or laptop become the backdrop for artists work. This work is done in tandem with creative play, survival and entrepreneurial drive.
<br>
<br>
I [design and run workshops](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) and give talks, [publish interviews](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/), [online publications](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/manual/), [podcasts](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/learning-unlearning-conversation-piupiu-faith-dilo) and manage artists too.

*[Foss Magazine](https://www.instagram.com/fossmagazine/)*<br>
**Editor **<br><br>
Foss is a self-initiated internet magazine which explores the interludes between art & sport. My co-editor and I research, attend exhibitions and conduct interviews to archive contemporary and historical imagery exploring these themes. Works of interest include Eddie Peake’s Touch (2012), a staged performance of naked footballers playing five-a-side football match. The work’s title Touch (2012) suggests the inherent tactility and homoerotic exhibitions that comes with contact sports.

*Koko Black*<br>
**Brand Strategist and Copywriter**<br><br>
Bryce Ford is the Creative Director of Koko Black, a contemporary chocolate company in Melbourne, Australia. Bryce contracted me to research and rewrite Koko Black's new brand strategy. This included collecting data and refining research on competitors, finding a tone of voice to fit the new aesthetic direction and present all the information in a readable document for the board and investors. At the same time I was also hired as a copywriter to produce content for the website, social media posts, seasonal events, competitions and names of products.

During my final months in New Zealand I worked with Mark and his team to organise photoshoots, videos, manage clientele and recruit new staff. I produced and managed the development of a streamlined digital presence, which included rebranding, curatorial decisions, copywriting and SEO enhancements on his social media accounts, email and website. I also wrote funding applications for creative photography, documentary projects and pitches for clients.

*[Cyber Nectar](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/)*
<br>**Festival Director and Producer **
<br><br>
Funded by Wellington City Council funded, New Zealand . Cyber Nectar references warm, alive bodies interacting with cold, dry pieces of technology. Roy Ascott theorised the term ‘moist media’ as a way of describing, ‘where wet living biologies meet dry computational systems’. Cyber Nectar responds and critiques issues raised by both Roy Ascott and other early cyber feminists by examining the psychological and physical experience of proto-digital life.

In collaboration with Garage Project, Women’s Refuge New Zealand, Wellington Rape Crisis, InsideOUT, an incredible organisation who work to make Aotearoa a safe(r) place for young people of diverse genders and sexualities.

*[Indulge in my vanity](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/curatorial-intervention-laura-duffy-nathaniel-gordon-stables/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at MEANWHILE GALLERY, Wellington, New Zealand . Curatorial intervention of The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use with tryptic video work by Nathaniel Gordon-Stables, accompanied by writing by Laura Duffy and edited by Dilohana Lekamge. In the curatorial intervention of the group show The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use (It is a relationship entered into) Laura Duffy has created space for an artist she feels deserves recognition, Nathaniel Gordon Stables. Nathaniel isn’t wāhine, he is tangata ira tane as well as takatāpui.
<br><br>
The idea of the curatorial intervention was to disrupt the notion of ‘women’, not only in the pre-existing exhibition, but to reconstruct the constraints that ‘women’ has as a category in order to be more inclusive and diverse. Cyber Nectar surrounds ideas of decolonisation: takatāpui in itself has an unfortunate history of being erased  within the process of colonisation and the western documentation of Maori culture. This intervention attempts to respect takatāpui and allow them to gain more visibility.

A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Emporium Vintage, Wellington, New Zealand . Text video installation, duration 5 minutes (continuous loop), Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg in collaboration with Sean Burn.<br><br>In rhetoric, parrhesia is a figure of speech described as: “to speak candidly or to ask forgiveness for so speaking”. In August 2016 Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg undertook a week long takeover of the Lokal stories Instagram and Twitter accounts. HPA wrote almost a thousand tweets. JB erased all of these by deleting approximately 150-200 a day. ‘Parrhesia’ is a selection of these tweets, which act as a series of poems or anxious truths around intimacy, grief, capitalism and how we mediate our ‘selves’, emotions and relationships through technology. Parrhesia is a animated text work designed by irl angel, Sean Burn.

**Producer and Project Manager**
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Fusion Surf Skate, Wellington, New Zealand . Performative video installation, duration 3 min 33 sec (continuous loop), Jordana Bragg and Hana Pera Aoake, in collaboration with Laura Duffy.<br><br>This video work uses the ocean and water as a way to frame the anxiety and emotional labours of capitalism and digital life. Filmed and edited in collaboration with Laura Duffy this video work flickers between footage spliced together to mimic the multitude of tabs open online. Its rhythm is designed to reflect the exponential rate at which colonialism and neoliberalism is destroying the world, and the paradoxical way capitalism and imperialism has constructed our identities and affected the rate of our productivity.

**Curator **
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at MEANWHILE GALLERY, Wellington, New Zealand . There is no one universalised experience of ‘otherness’, but how might these individual narratives we live come together to inform a complexity of concerns around the body and digital life? The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use (It is a relationship entered into) is an exhibition of work by national and international wāhine artists and writers. Each artist creates work that is embodied, marked by their experiences and offers ways of expressing empathy through self care, repetition, unlearning/learning and humour.

At Femur Design I helped manage the team that designs instant and intuitive musical experiences for the web, iOS and Android. For example [Theremin](https://femurdesign.com/theremin/) is a touch playable synthesiser. I collaborated with the team on the timeline and managed the brand strategy, launch, press releases, videos and mail outs. Our most recent project involved two other senior developers to create [Blokdust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNZfOMJybjM), a web app which allows users to build instruments and make self-playing sound environments.

**Mentor and Workshop Leader **
<br><br>
I think it's important to empower young people, that’s why I worked with the National Citizen Service. I guided 16-19 year olds to volunteer at their local dementia homes, to share their joint passion for art and music with the elderly people they visited. These experiences have taught me the importance of safeguarding, participating in youth lead curriculums and clear communication in challenging circumstances.

<br>

This was the first Kollektiv gallery. It was during this gallery that we became an a award winning cooperative, exploring notions of collectivity and dispersion, focusing on group residences and exhibitions with a shared curatorial element. The residency takes groups of artists who manage a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kollektivgallery/kollektivs-first-ever-gallery), acquire a vacant property, collaborate on a concept and curate the art together with a totally hands on approach to installing the exhibition and teaching events. 

I learnt a huge amount about funding, planning, delegating, managing people and marketing. It was for this gallery and residency that I was awarded Most Outstanding Social Entrepreneur of the South East of England, 2014.

<br>
Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under 2 hours. Fast Art lovingly forces us to trust our gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside each of ourselves. The workshop smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allows us to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation, whilst reigniting a love for idea generation, team spirit and face-to-face selling.

[Alicia King](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/alicia-king/) is an interdisciplinary artist from Melbourne Australia, her practice explores contemporary and cultural relationships with technology. She responds to today’s global engagement with technology that eternally places humans on the brink of the future. King examines tools of biological technologies to understand perspectives of the human body as a conceptually loaded, complex and raw material.
