<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Since <span class="bold-number">1989</span>, art has been the language I speak and the bible I swear by. My lifelong creative education ranges a beautiful repository of art, music, movement, science, philosophy and technology.

My existence till now has been distilled with insights from my brother's interest in artificial intelligence and accompanied by the admiration I have for my intellectually intimidating sister. Drawing was used by my mother to help me learn and silence me when I was a nuisance. And thankfully, my father snuck business into all conversations about art, for survival purposes.

Like other millennials, I watched the internet enter it's adolescence and anonymously sought thrills from fascinating and disturbing chatrooms. These days I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. Empathy, mental health, social action and being a good ally play a huge role in my self initiated projects. As you read this, I'm planning a new project which explores how technology is changing the human workforce and as a result, impacting our psychological state. 

During 2016 I was honoured to be awarded funding by Creative New Zealand to produce the first ever [Lokal Stories](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories) with two Māori / Pākehā feminist artists and writers. Our collaboration explored and dismantled the ways in which the hetero-patriarchal, neo-colonial culture we live in has shaped online identities and harassment today.

Right now I'm residing in Melbourne, Australia eager to start new projects.

During the last three years I have worked alongside Luke Phillips, an extremely talented composer and developer. Together we create instant and intuitive musical websites, like [Theremin](https://femurdesign.com/theremin/). Our collaboration has inspired my practice to focus more on technology and futurism.

##### [Fast Art](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) - Producer and Workshop Designer
Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under two hours. I designed Fast Art to lovingly force people to trust their gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside themselves. Fast Art smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allow participants to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation.
