<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Since <span class="bold-number">1989</span>, art has been the language I speak and the bible I swear by. My lifelong creative education ranges a beautiful repository of art, music, movement, science, philosophy and technology.

<span class="caption">Self Portrait by Sophie Giblin, 2013</span>

My existence till now has been distilled with insights from my brother's interest in artificial intelligence and accompanied by the admiration I have for my intellectually intimidating sister. Drawing was used by my mother to help me learn and silence me when I was a nuisance. And thankfully, my father snuck business into all conversations about art, for survival purposes.

Like other millennials, I watched the internet enter it's adolescence and anonymously sought thrills from fascinating and disturbing chatrooms. These days I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. Empathy, mental health, social action and being a good ally play a huge role in my self initiated projects. As you read this, I'm planning a new project which explores how technology is changing the human workforce and as a result, impacting our psychological state. 

During 2016 I was honoured to be awarded funding by Creative New Zealand to produce the first ever [Lokal Stories](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories) with two Māori / Pākehā feminist artists and writers. Our collaboration explored and dismantled the ways in which the hetero-patriarchal, neo-colonial culture we live in has shaped online identities and harassment today.

After six unforgettable years pouring myself into Kollektiv Gallery I've been fortunate enough to be given a job at London's glorious Hayward Gallery. Having just finished a massive refurbishment, we've reopened the gallery with an enormous Andreas Gursky retrospective. This exhibition runs till 22nd April 2018, so come, stand infront of these distored realities and ask me questions about the art. 

###### February – October 2016

##### [Lokal Stories](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/) - Fundraiser, Project Manager and Curator
I designed Lokal Stories as a residency for artists to explore social and political inequalities through artist collaborations across the globe. The first ever Lokal Stories took place in Wellington, New Zealand with two local Māori / Pākehā artists and writers, Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg. Cyber Nectar was the title of the three month residency, where Hana and Jordana examined the psychological and physical experience of proto-digital life through writing, video and installation. I managed every aspect of the project including the fundraising, location hunting, artist management, online PR and curatorial decisions.


###### August 2016 - ongoing

##### [Femur Design](http://femurdesign.com/) - Visual Experience Designer
At Femur Design I manage the team that designs instant and intuitive musical experiences for the web, iOS and Android. For example [Theremin](https://femurdesign.com/theremin/) is a touch playable synthesiser. I collaborated with the team on the visual experience and managed the launch, press releases, videos and mail outs. Our most recent project involved two other senior developers to create [Blokdust](https://blokdust.com/), a web app which allows users to build instruments and make self-playing sound environments.

##### [Fast Art](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) - Producer and Workshop Designer
Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under two hours. I designed Fast Art to lovingly force people to trust their gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside themselves. Fast Art smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allow participants to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation.
