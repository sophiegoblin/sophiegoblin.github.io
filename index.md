<span class="caption">Self portrait by Sophie Giblin, 2013</span>

My existence till now has been distilled with insights from my brother's interest in artificial intelligence and accompanied by the admiration I have for my intellectually intimidating sister. Drawing was used by my mother to help me learn and silence me when I was a nuisance. And thankfully, my father snuck business into all conversations about art, for survival purposes. All these things have dramatically shaped my skill set and interests as an artist and curator today.

Like other millennials, I watched the internet enter it's adolescence and anonymously sought thrills from fascinating and disturbing chatrooms. These days I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. Empathy and emotion, social action and art-as-ally play huge role in my projects. As you read this, I'm planning a new exhibition which explores how technology has, and still is changing the human workforce and as a result, impacted our psychological state. 

I'm influenced by incredible humans like Ken Robinson, writer and educator, a true patron of creativity bringing emotional intelligence into education. Marina Abramovic, a powerful performance artist who enriches her practice with collaboration and teaching. Hans Ulrich Obrist, a curator, historian and critic, who enthusiastically visits artists around the world to shape their work for exhibitions.

Finally, I'm honoured to announce, since moving to New Zealand, I have been awarded Wellington Council and Creative NZ funding to curate the first ever Lokal Stories with two emerging Māori / Pākehā feminist artists and writers. Our collaboration will explore and dismantle the ways in which the hetero-patriarchal, neo-colonial culture we live in has shaped online identities and harassment today.

##### [Kollektiv Gallery](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/) - Director
The year I graduated, I also founded Kollektiv Gallery. This now award winning initiative designs and runs educational programmes and curates artistic collaborations. Together with the participants, artists, institutions and community, I turn unused spaces into public exhibitions. I also [visually interview](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/) hundreds of global artists and have written a [free and extensive manual](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/manual/) on starting collectives, crowdfunding and open galleries. 

###### February 2016 – ongoing

##### Lokal Stories - Fundraiser, Project Manager and Curator
Lokal Stories was born in the UK and traveled to New Zealand in January 2016 with the aim to explore social and political inequalities through artist collaborations, across the globe. The first ever Lokal Stories will take place in Wellington, New Zealand with [Hana Pera Aoake](http://blueoysterdunedin.tumblr.com/post/93824711984/a-maze-a-meditation-thoughts-on-to-two-recent) and [Jordana Bragg](http://www.ada.net.nz/artbase/jordana-bragg/). Using art & discussion, they will evaluate feminism and misogynistic prevalence on and offline. 

###### August 2016 - ongoing

##### [Femur Design](http://femurdesign.com/theremin/) - Visual Experience Designer
During the last 2 years, I have worked alongside my best friend, Luke Phillips, an extremely talented composer and developer. Together we create instant and intuitive musical websites. Our collaboration has taught me the importance of technology and even gave me the skills to build this website. As a team, we are always looking for new opportunities to explore experimental sound with new technologies.

###### May 2014 - ongoing

##### [Fast Art](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) - Workshop Designer and Leader
Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under 2 hours. I designed this workshop to lovingly force people to trust their gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside themselves. The workshop smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allow participants to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation.

###### 2013 - ongoing

##### [Public Speaker and Educator](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiegiblin)
I tell stories and share my experiences about starting-up Kollektiv Gallery. I have spoken at events all over the UK and Europe to encourage creatives to be proactive and make social change in their community. Talks turn into individual meetings, which then turn into mentoring sessions with institutions, companies and community groups.
