<h3 class="center">ABOUT</h3>

Sophie Giblin is an Artist and Producer, she studied Performance and Visual Art, majoring in sound at University of Brighton in 2013. Once graduated she noticed Brighti had a lack of infrastructure to support artists in their careers; she founded Kollektiv Gallery which turned vacant properties into temporary public art spaces to exhibit artist's experiments. Sophie grew Kollektiv into an online archive of artist interviews and started producing art festivals, eventually moving to New Zealand to run Cyber Nectar art festival.
<br><br>Sophie is a public speaker, producer and art manager, currently residing in London, working at the Hayward Gallery and returning to her Sound practice running an experimental choir.

*[The Big Art Herstory Project](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/)*<br>
**Producer**

The Big Art Herstory Project runs educational tours across London’s museums and galleries, designed to offer anyone a compelling way to learn about the overlooked female narratives of Art History. In November 2019, our team hosted ['FINDING ARTEMISIA / UN-Heroic Traditions'](https://www.bigartherstoryproject.com/finding-artemisia), an exhibition of new works created by Luisa-Maria MacCormack alongside two weeks of empowering events that explore the complex and layered history of our visual narratives of gender-based violence.
<br><br>Luisa's drawings were the culmination of six months of intense work in collaboration with six women, all of whom have had personal experiences with gender-based violence. Inspired by the powerful archetypes taken from the oeuvre of Artemisia Gentileschi, a C16th female artist whose long-awaited exhibition arrives at the National Gallery next year. The exhibition offered a direct challenge to the outdated tradition of the ‘silent muse’ through the visual and narrative empowerment of each sitter.

*[Kollektiv Gallery](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/)*<br>
**Founder and Curator **
<br>
<br>
Kollektiv Gallery produces residencies, festivals, exhibitions and symposia. Interested in the ethics of inhabiting space by reacting to the semiotics of the city; a car, empty butchery, office, warehouse or laptop become the backdrop for artists work. This work is done in tandem with creative play, survival and entrepreneurial drive.
<br>
<br>
Sophie [runs workshops](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/fast-art/) and give talks, [publishes interviews](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/), [online publications](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/manual/), [podcasts](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/learning-unlearning-conversation-piupiu-faith-dilo) and manages artists too.

*[Foss Magazine](https://www.instagram.com/fossmagazine/)*<br>
**Magazine Editor **<br><br>
Foss is a self-initiated internet magazine which explores the interludes between art, fashion and sport. Sophie Giblin and Fabio Coverini and co-editors, avid cyclists, swimmers and football hooligans, they see vibrant playful and political art made within these intersections, which they started archiving into one Instagram account. Inspired by the 2019 Women’s World Cup, they attend London matches and sport exhibitions, joined a football reading book club and interview artists working in this sphere.

*Hayward Gallery, London*<br>
**Tour Guide**<br><br>
Hayward Gallery is a world-renowned contemporary art gallery and a landmark of brutalist architecture at Southbank Centre in London. I absorb and relay knowledge to the public about the current exhibiting artists, the cultural environment of each work and the curatorial direction for the exhibition and well as support other tour guides in training. Sophie has delivered hour long tours for Lee Bul: Crashing, Space Shifters and Kader Attia: Museum of Emotion and Bridget Riley.

*Letting Objects Speak, London*<br>
**Producer **<br><br>
Kollektiv Gallery group show at SET Bermondsey, London . Presenting a range of video, objects and performance-based works, the artists in this exhibition employ an excavation framework to trace a journey of interpretation around extinction, colonisation, power and agency.


[Letting Objects Speak](https://www.facebook.com/events/567811347009712/) was organised over a six week period, resulting in a one day curatorial intervention workshop and exhibition and handout.

*Mark Tantrum Photography Ltd*<br>
**Studio and Production Manager**
<br><br>
Mark Tantrum is a commercial events photographer and documentary maker. During my final months in New Zealand I organised photo and video shoots, managed clientele bookings, recruited new staff and helped plan at the meetings.

*[Cyber Nectar](http://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/)*
<br>**Festival Director and Producer **
<br><br>
Cyber Nectar references warm, alive bodies interacting with cold, dry pieces of technology. Roy Ascott theorised the term ‘moist media’ as a way of describing, ‘where wet living biologies meet dry computational systems’. Cyber Nectar responds and critiques issues raised by both Roy Ascott and other early cyber feminists by examining the psychological and physical experience of proto-digital life.

Cyber Nectar was funded by Wellington City Council and New Zealand  government.

*[DARKMATTER](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/finale-darkmatter-friends/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at New Zealand Portrait Gallery . “What feminine part of yourself did you have to destroy in order to survive in this world? At what point does femininity become synonymous with apology? Who hurt the people who hurt you? DARKMATTER’s Alok Vaid-Menon is trying to figure it out.”<br><br>
In collaboration with Garage Project, Women’s Refuge New Zealand, Wellington Rape Crisis, InsideOUT, an incredible organisation who work to make Aotearoa a safe(r) place for young people of diverse genders and sexualities. Other supports and funders were JPEG2000, Creative New Zealand, Wellington City Council Public Art Grants and New Zealand Portrait Gallery.

*[Indulge in my vanity](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/curatorial-intervention-laura-duffy-nathaniel-gordon-stables/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**<br><br>
Curatorial intervention of 'The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use' with tryptic video work by Nathaniel Gordon-Stables, accompanied by writing by Laura Duffy and edited by Dilohana Lekamge. In the curatorial intervention of the group show Laura Duffy created space for an artist she feels deserves recognition, Nathaniel Gordon Stables. Nathaniel isn’t wāhine, he is tangata ira tane as well as takatāpui.
<br><br>
The idea of the curatorial intervention was to disrupt the notion of ‘women’, not only in the pre-existing exhibition, but to reconstruct the constraints that ‘women’ has as a category in order to be more inclusive and diverse. Cyber Nectar surrounds ideas of decolonisation: takatāpui in itself has an unfortunate history of being erased  within the process of colonisation and the western documentation of Maori culture. This intervention attempts to respect takatāpui and allow them to gain more visibility.

*[Parrhesia](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/parrhesia/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Emporium Vintage, Wellington, New Zealand . Text video installation, duration 5 minutes (continuous loop), Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg in collaboration with Sean Burn.<br><br>In rhetoric, parrhesia is a figure of speech described as: “to speak candidly or to ask forgiveness for so speaking”. In August 2016 Hana Pera Aoake and Jordana Bragg undertook a week long takeover of the Lokal stories Instagram and Twitter accounts. HPA wrote almost a thousand tweets. JB erased all of these by deleting approximately 150-200 a day. ‘Parrhesia’ is a selection of these tweets, which act as a series of poems or anxious truths around intimacy, grief, capitalism and how we mediate our ‘selves’, emotions and relationships through technology. Parrhesia is a animated text work designed by irl angel, Sean Burn.

*[What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/want-say-owe-happiness-life/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at Fusion Surf Skate, Wellington, New Zealand . Performative video installation, duration 3 min 33 sec (continuous loop), Jordana Bragg and Hana Pera Aoake, in collaboration with Laura Duffy.<br><br>This video work uses the ocean and water as a way to frame the anxiety and emotional labours of capitalism and digital life. Filmed and edited in collaboration with Laura Duffy this video work flickers between footage spliced together to mimic the multitude of tabs open online. Its rhythm is designed to reflect the exponential rate at which colonialism and neoliberalism is destroying the world, and the paradoxical way capitalism and imperialism has constructed our identities and affected the rate of our productivity.

*[The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/lokalstories/gaze-not-something-use/)*<br>
**Producer and Project Manager**
<br><br>
A Cyber Nectar event by Kollektiv Gallery at MEANWHILE GALLERY, Wellington, New Zealand .
<br><br>There is no one universalised experience of ‘otherness’, but how might these individual narratives we live come together to inform a complexity of concerns around the body and digital life? The Gaze is Not Something You Have or Use (It is a relationship entered into) is an exhibition of work by national and international wāhine artists and writers. Each artist creates work that is embodied, marked by their experiences and offers ways of expressing empathy through self care, repetition, unlearning/learning and humour.

Femur Design is a small team of developers who design and build musical instruments to help people learn how to play music. At Femur Design Sophie managed the code and design team who built instant and intuitive musical experiences for the web, iOS and Android. For example [Theremin](https://femurdesign.com/theremin/) is a touch playable synthesiser. Sophie worked on the timeline and managed the brand strategy, launch, press releases, videos and mail outs. Our most recent project involved two other senior developers to create [Blokdust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNZfOMJybjM), a web app which allows users to build instruments and make self-playing sound environments.<br>

**Mentor and Workshop Leader **
<br><br>
Sophie's work often revolves around community, in 2015 she worked with NCS to empower young people, guiding 16-19 year olds to volunteer at their local dementia homes to share their joint passion for art and music with the elderly people. Working with the NCS was an important chance to practice safeguarding and clear communication in challenging circumstances as well as find new ways to participate in youth lead curriculums.

*Kollektiv Gallery*<br>
**Creative Consultant**
<br><br>
Double Gazing was one of the projects Sophie worked on with illustrator and Kollekitv Alumni, Amy Brown. Amy was already drawing fantastic portraits through windows for fun when the two started having regular consultancy chats. Together they decided to brand what Amy was doing as 'Double Gazing' and design a package to sell at events. Since then, Amy has drawn at Southbank Centre, magazine launches and gallery openings.

*Death By Gallery*<br>
**Gallery Director, Producer, Artist Manager**<br><br>
Death by Gallery was opened with 10 Kollektiv artists at 16 Brighton Square, funded by Kickstarter, Santander and Brighton University, supported by Brighton Fringe and Open House Brighton  . After publicising the opportunity, interviewing and choosing the artists, together we completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, worked with We Are Pop Up to find a vacant shop in Brighton and turn it into a pop up gallery for one month. Every artist taught a workshop and we also hosted guest speakers and musicians as well.

*The Butchery* <br>
**Founder, Producer, Artist Manager**
<br><br>
In 2013 Sophie founded Kollektiv Gallery after seeing more and more artists fall into unpaid work. Kollektiv started as school, building residencies for creatives to learn new skills, like launch a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kollektivgallery/kollektivs-first-ever-gallery), open a gallery, learn about contracts, put on an event, sell art and connect with the community.
<br><br>
Kollektiv has taken many forms. From the school, it merged into an agency, connecting creatives to businesses. Artists, photographers, animators and illustrators would take part in a picture interview to be part of the archive, acting as a publicity tool and portfolio for clients to view. 
<br><br>
Kollektiv then started producing art festivals, which started in Brighton and ended up in Wellington, New Zealand. The festivals were funded by the government and council and included, podcasts, documentaries, exhibitions and symposiums. Collaborating with a wide array of institutions, charities and community members, the festival format became one of my favourites.
<br>

Here are some event and photos from our verys first Kollektiv Gallery Redidency Gallery, The Butchery.<br>

**[Fast Art Designer and Facilitator](https://youtu.be/a7K3sphNEV4)**
<br><br>
Fast Art is a speedily paced, creative entrepreneurship workshop, where teams must start, finish and sell a project in under 2 hours. Fast Art lovingly forces us to trust our gut, let go of expectations and pay homage to the ingenious child inside each of ourselves. The workshop smashes up the usual agile-innovation techniques, allows us to act on raw instinctive decision making and physical creation, whilst reigniting a love for idea generation, team spirit and face-to-face selling.

<h3 class="center">PUBLISHING </h3>
<br>
Since <span class="bold-number">2014</span> I have published over <span class="bold-number">200</span> [picture interviews](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/) on Kollekitv Gallery. I ask 10 questions and artists respond visually. This method of networking and publicity compliments my curatorial relationship with artists, a way for artists to develop their visual practice as well as have content to share online.<br>

Here are a few examples.<br>

[Jordana Bragg](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/jordana-bragg/), multi-disciplinary artists based in New Zealand, Concentrating on the metaphysics of love and loss, their practice discloses a characteristically dangerous personal and universal sense of vulnerability, informed by wider research around issues of identity and gender fluidity. Bragg is co-founder of the artist run initiatives Meanwhile (NZ) and Friends are Artists/Freunde sind Künstler (DE).

<span class="caption">Jordana Bragg, "What do you fight for?" 2016 interview, Kollektiv</span>

[Alicia King](https://www.kollektivgallery.com/artists/alicia-king/) is an interdisciplinary artist from Melbourne Australia, her practice explores contemporary and cultural relationships with technology. She responds to today’s global engagement with technology that eternally places humans on the brink of the future. King examines tools of biological technologies to understand perspectives of the human body as a conceptually loaded, complex and raw material.
