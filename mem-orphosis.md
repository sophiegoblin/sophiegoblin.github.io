<h3 class="center">MEM-ORPHOSIS</h3>

“Do not trust your memory; it is a net full of holes; the most beautiful prizes slip through it.”
Georges Duhamel

Mem-orphosis investigates the neuroscience of the human memory. This theme originated from my personal anxiety with dyslexia and an unwelcome dread of dementia. Scientific research led to the discovery that each time a memory is conjured, it is created through bits and pieces of experience and imagination. Every memory a human imagines is fabricated, it changes more and more every time we use it. A constant renewal is taking place; this means we are altering our memories without realising. Consequently all human memories are unreliable and unstable.

Learning through drawing repetitive lines for extensive periods of time is a discipline which creates an internal rhythm. Repetition is implied but each line drawn is individual and separate. Each unique line has an impact on the proceeding line drawn. This ever-morphing, visual rhythm offers a representation of the metamorphosing human memory, where the first line made is nothing like the finishing line.
