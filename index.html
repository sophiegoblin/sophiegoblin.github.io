    <div class="about">
      
      <p>Since <span class="numbers">1989</span> art has been the language I speak and bible I swear by. My lifelong creative education, fused with insights from my overly enthusiastic big brother who studied artificial intelligence, along side my intimidating sister, who wanted to be a politician when she was 12, dramatically shaped my skill set and interests as an artist and curator today.</p>
      
      <p>I find the internet fascinating and disturbing. I listen to science podcasts and pay attention at futurist talks. As you read this, I'm researching a new exhibition exploring how technology has changed the human workforce and as a result, impacted our psychological state.</p>

      <p>I'm influenced by incredible humans like Ken Robinson, writer and educator, a true patron of creativity. He brings emotional intelligence back into education. Marina Abramovic, a powerful performance artist who puts energy into collaboration and teaching. Finally, Hans Ulrich Obrist a curator, historian and critic, who spends his weekends visiting emerging artists around the world to shape their work for exhibitions.</p>

      <span class="job-title">Kollektiv Gallery - Director</span>
      <p class="job-description">Three years ago I founded Kollektiv Gallery. This award winning inititive designs and runs educational programmes, to cultivate confidence in early career artists. Together with the participants, I run crowdfunding campaigns to turn empty buildings into public art spaces. I interview artists globally for the Kollektiv website and publish extensive manuals to teach people how to crowdfund and open galleries. I have organised 8 exhibitions in England and interviewed over 200 creatives.</p>
