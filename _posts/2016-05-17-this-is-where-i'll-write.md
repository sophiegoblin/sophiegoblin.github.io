title:  "This is Where i'll Write"
---
I'm learning to code because I don't want to use Facebook any more. If i'm online, I want to be writing for myself, to learn, to improve, to remember, to serve myself, like a server. I don't want to show off or update 600 friends, I always over think it. Do you want my news? Then call me, I have Skype and FaceTime. Send me a letter, I have an address.

Facebook has disconnected me from my old English life. It's taken 7 months. Now all I see is weird international news for expats and magazine updates. FB phased out my friends, and i've probably be phased out too.

I'm saying goodbye.

This is a place for my thoughts about being on the other side of the world. Here in sie this Sublime text box is nice. Writing with Mark Down. Does that mean i'm code-cheating? Luke says i'm not cheating. But this doesn't feel scary like CSS and HTML. I'll learn MD for sure.
