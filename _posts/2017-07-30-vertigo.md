I know I shouldn't be sat in bed, slouching whilst writing. Two days ago I was told by a chiropractor that my neck looks like I've been in a car crash. Because of it i've felt a pendulum swaying back and forth through my entire body for eight months now. I’ll sit up straight and prop my laptop up on a cushion. Since he cracked my neck and spine I still feel it, just a faint sway, nothing like it’s been for the last couple of months. 

There’s a cheeky indian myna bird hopping about on the fence outside, looking at me through the window. I feel a bit frayed, I suppose I drank a fair amount last night. The sky is bright white today, it makes the back of my eyes ache. I was convinced I was losing my eye site three days ago. I had blurry, flashy vision. I’ve been imagining what it would be like to go blind.

The little electric heater is on, even though it’s expensive to run I don’t give a shit, but I should. During the last six months I haven't been able to work much, let alone give any of my attention to Kollektiv. I’ve taken a few drips and drags of copywriting, artist management, one modelling job that a friend got me. In fact all the jobs I got were through the kindness of my friends. 

The friendships I've made in Melbourne have been real and grounding, more real than I’ve let any friendship be for years. I know what the different is, of course. During the last six months I’ve given people attention. I’ve written back. I haven’t talked about work, because I’ve had none. I said *yes* a lot more. I’ve turned up to parties, yoga, camping, lunches. I’ve been honest about feeling broken and useless. I’ve laughed about being unemployed, earning the title *Lady of Leisure* or *LoL* for short. Maybe i'm just learning to be myself again.

I had a burnout ten months ago, then one night I was woken up by the appartment swaying, shaking, crumbling, to the sound of screaming and tears. I'd never experienced an earthquake before. All Luke and I could do was hold onto each other. Maybe I internalised the aftershocks. Whatever happened I slowly traumatised my upper spine. And the area which houses the nervous system related to balance and vision couldn't send the right signals to my brain anymore.

Before I saw my spinal x-rays I didn't have an answer for the vertigo, I was in a state of confusion for eight months. I'd lost control. I took time off to remedy the panic attacks and anxiety, hoping a slower state of mind would help me find stillness again. Saying all that, life has been more beautiful over the last eight months. I really mean *beautiful*. My eyes and ears have been working differently. I started taking photographs again because of it. I've also been singing, crying, laughing, writing music and I feel more in love with Luke than ever before.
